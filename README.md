The Enigma machine was a cipher device developed and used extensively by Nazi Germany during World War II. 
The purpose was to encrypt message turn it into cipher text(scrambled) using rotor wiring position to keep them secret.
Only those who had the secret key can decrypt the cipher text to read the original messages.

HOW TO USE:

0. Rearrange rotor 1-10 positions inside main.cpp (Optional if you wanna use your own rotor wiring) and recompile(MUST if rotor were changed) into new main.exe using MinGW-w64.

1. Enter your original message inside "plain" file(notepad/VS studio code/anything suitable).
2. Run main.exe.
3. View your encrypted messages inside "encrypt" file.
4. Your encrypted messages will be decrypt back to original messages inside "decrypt" file.
5. If the messages on "decrypt" file is the same as your "plain" file, then your rotor wiring is correct.

WHAT YOU CAN DO WITH IT:

Implement on your project in creative way lol.
